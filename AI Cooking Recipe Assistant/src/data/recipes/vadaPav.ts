  description: 'Vada Pav is a popular street food from Maharashtra, India. Often called the Indian burger, it consists of a spicy potato fritter (vada) sandwiched between a small bread roll (pav) with various chutneys.',
  tips: [
    'Make sure the oil is hot enough before frying the vadas. Test by dropping a small amount of batter - it should sizzle and rise immediately.',
    'The potato mixture should be completely cool before shaping into patties to avoid breaking.',
    'For extra flavor, add a thin layer of dry garlic chutney directly on the vada.'
